# AI-Powered Virtual Fitness Assistant
This repository contains the code and resources for the AI-Powered Virtual Fitness Assistant, a computer vision-based fitness tracking system designed to monitor biceps curls, squats, and provide real-time feedback. This project was developed as part of a course project, integrating machine learning, speech recognition, and Raspberry Pi hardware for an interactive workout experience.

Project Overview:
The AI-powered virtual fitness assistant utilizes the following technologies:

Pose Estimation: Using MoveNet, the system tracks key points on the userâ€™s body to detect specific exercises.
Voice Commands: SpeechRecognition library allows users to switch between exercises like biceps curls and squats hands-free using voice commands.
Real-Time Feedback: The Sense HAT on the Raspberry Pi displays live feedback, showing repetition counts during the workout session.
Multi-threading: Ensures smooth operation by handling exercise detection and voice command processing simultaneously.
Key Features:
Accurate tracking of biceps curls and squats using pose estimation with OpenCV and MoveNet.
Voice command integration for seamless switching between exercises.
Real-time exercise feedback displayed on the Sense HAT.
Multi-threaded architecture for handling simultaneous exercise tracking and voice input.
Technologies Used:
Python for the core implementation.
OpenCV for video processing and computer vision.
MoveNet for real-time pose estimation.
SpeechRecognition library for voice commands.
Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT for hardware integration and user feedback.
Multi-threading to manage tasks concurrently.
